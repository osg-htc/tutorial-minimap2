    "HTCondor is a **workload manager** that enables researchers to distribute computing tasks across many machines—an approach known as **High Throughput Computing (HTC)**. Unlike High Performance Computing (HPC), which focuses on tightly coupled parallel jobs, HTC excels at handling **many independent tasks**, each of which can run separately on different nodes. This makes it a perfect fit for bioinformatics workloads like read mapping, assembly, and sequence analysis, where datasets can be partitioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "When mapping reads, our FASTQ files often contain **tens of millions of reads**. Mapping all of these reads in a single job can take hours or days and often risks failure if a single node crashes. Instead, we can **split the FASTQ file** into smaller chunks—say, 10,000 reads each—and map them *independently*. Each subset becomes its own **Condor job**.\n",

    "### Job Template — Preparing a Scalable Submit File\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve seen how to create a submit file that runs **one job** — mapping a single FASTQ subset to a reference genome.\n",
    "But what if we have **dozens or hundreds of subsets** that we want to map *in parallel*?\n",
    "Instead of writing and submitting a separate file for each subset, HTCondor allows us to turn our single-job submit file into a **job template** that can automatically scale to many jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Concept: From One Job → Many Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "HTCondor’s strength lies in managing many independent tasks.\n",
    "To do this efficiently, we can make our submit file **scalable** — meaning it can accept **variables** that change for each queued job.\n",
    "This allows us to define one flexible template and use different input values for each job (for example, different FASTQ subsets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with our original single-job setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "arguments = humpback_whale_ref_genome.fasta.mmi subset_ab_humpback_whale_reads.fastq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command runs `run_minimap2.sh` on one subset. For example, `run_minimap2.sh humpback_whale_ref_genome.fasta.mmi subset_ab_humpback_whale_reads.fastq`.\n",
    "To scale up, we can replace the hard-coded subset name with a **variable**, such as `$(reads_subset)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about the reference genome (`humpback_whale_ref_genome.fasta.mmi`)?\n",
    "In this case, we want to keep it constant across all jobs, so we leave it as is. Reference genomes are typically large files that don’t change between jobs, so it doesn't make sense to make them into a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "HTCondor allows you to define **custom variables** that can be reused throughout your submit file.\n",
    "You can then assign different values to these variables for each job when queuing multiple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "arguments = humpback_whale_ref_genome.fasta.mmi $(reads_subset)\n",
    "transfer_input_files = osdf:///ospool//uc-shared/public/osg-training/tutorial-minimap2/inputs/humpback_whale_ref_genome.fasta.mmi, inputs/$(reads_subset)\n",
    "transfer_output_files = mapped_$(reads_subset)_reads_to_genome_sam_sorted.bam\n",
    "transfer_output_remaps = \"mapped_$(reads_subset)_reads_to_genome_sam_sorted.bam = outputs/mapped_$(reads_subset)_reads_to_genome_sam_sorted.bam\"\n",
    "output = ./logs/$(Cluster)_$(Process)_$(reads_subset)_mapping.out\n",
    "error  = ./logs/$(Cluster)_$(Process)_$(reads_subset)_mapping.err\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, each time a job is queued, HTCondor will substitute the variable `$(reads_subset)` with the value you provide — just like a placeholder in a template.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that we did not include the `$(reads_subset)` variable in the log file. This is because the log file is shared across all jobs in the queue, and including a job-specific variable would create multiple log files with the same name, leading to confusion. Instead, we use `$(Cluster)` and `$(Process)` to uniquely identify each job's output and error files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our recommendation is to keep a single log file per submit file submission**, which will contain entries for all jobs submitted from that file. Whereas the output and error files should be unique per job, which is why we include the `$(reads_subset)` variable in their filenames.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Queuing Multiple Jobs with `queue` and Variable Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now tell HTCondor to queue one job for each subset of data, assigning a different variable value each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "queue reads_subset from listOfReads.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `listOfReads.txt` might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "subset_ab_humpback_whale_reads.fastq\n",
    "subset_cd_humpback_whale_reads.fastq\n",
    "subset_ef_humpback_whale_reads.fastq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "condor_submit run_multi_minimap2.sub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "HTCondor will automatically create **many jobs**, substituting each `$(reads_subset)` in the template with one line from the file. This queuing strategy works similarly to a `while` or `for` loop in programming."
